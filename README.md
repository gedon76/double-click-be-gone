This mod will get rid of double clicks made in a set delay.

So basically, if you have a double clicking keyboard/mouse, this mod will help you a little :)

Caution: This mode was made for casual players, if you're a sweat, then this mod may mess with your gameplay. DO NOT USE ON DIFFICULTY OVER <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/geometry-dash/images/2/22/Hard.svg/revision/latest?cb=20170202121510" width=15> Hard 4*
